Since we are not required to modify the original string but to simply change its order to reverse one, we can use two pointers to copy the
pointing char to a new string.

class Solution {
public:
    string reverseString(string s) {
        string res(s);
        int start = 0, end = s.size() - 1;
        while(start < end){
            res[start] = s[end];
            res[end] = s[start];
            ++start;
            --end;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
