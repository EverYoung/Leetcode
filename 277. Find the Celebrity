Use two pointers, one from the front and one from the back, to gradually narrow down the possible candidate for celebrity, using knows 
relation. The rule is as following: Say we have pointer left and right, if left knows right then left must not be celebrity. And if left 
does not know right, right must not be celebrity. Once these two pointers meet each other, they must point to a possible candidate for 
celebrity. Then we check whether the candidate knows someone or whether thare is someone does not know him/her.

Code:

// Forward declaration of the knows API.
bool knows(int a, int b);

class Solution {
public:
    int findCelebrity(int n) {
        int left = 0, right = n-1;
        while(left < right){
            if(knows(left, right)) left++;
            else right--;
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(i == left) continue;
            else if(!knows(i, left) || knows(left, i)) return -1;
        }
        return left;
    }
};
