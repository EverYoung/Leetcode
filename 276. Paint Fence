Dynamic Programming.

Two variables: same and diff, for the number of combinations at the former post by choosing the same color as the former post or a 
different color.

Two cases for current post:
1. paint the same color as the former one: we get diff combinations.
2. paint a different color from the former one: we get (k-1) * (same + diff).
And totally we get diff + (k-1) * (same + diff) possible combinations at current post, and we move tp the next post.

Code:(dp1 -> same, dp2 -> diff)
class Solution {
public:
    int numWays(int n, int k) {
        if(n==0 || k==0) return 0;
        int dp1 = 0, dp2 = 0;
        dp1 = 0;
        dp2 = k;
        for(int i=1; i<n; i++){
            int temp = dp2;
            dp2 = (dp1 + dp2) * (k-1);
            dp1 = temp;
        }
        return dp1+dp2;
    }
};
