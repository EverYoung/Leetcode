The idea is to find the last group of continuous nodes with value 9. Keep two pointer, prev pointer finally will stop before the last
group of nodes that has value 9. Then we can just add 1 to prev pointer's node and make all the nodes behind 0;

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* plusOne(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy->next = head;
        ListNode *cur = head, *prev = dummy;
        while(cur != NULL){
            if(cur->val != 9) prev = cur;
            cur = cur->next;
        }
        prev->val += 1;
        while(prev->next != NULL) {
            prev = prev->next;
            prev->val = 0;
        }
        
        if(dummy->val == 1) head = dummy;
        else{
            head = dummy->next;
            free(dummy);
        }
        return head;
    }
};
