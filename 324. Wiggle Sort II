The wiggle property is changed to be stricter than Wiggle Sort I, and the problem become far more complicated.

To solve this problem and avoid placing two identical number together, we can first extract all the numbers out in some order and place
them back in some relation. Therefore, there are two main part to solve this problem.
(1) Partition: put all the small number which should be in the even position in a part, and then put all the larger number which sould be in
the odd position in another part.
(2) Placement: place numbers back to the array at even/odd position according to which part they are in.

1. Sorting for partition, then placement. ----O(nlogn) time and O(n) space
The most easy way to do the partition is sorting, after which all the smaller numbers are in the front half, and all the larger numbers are 
in the back half. And then the placement, we just put the number in the front half into even positions and the numbers in the back half into
odd positions.

Code:

class Solution {
public:
    void wiggleSort(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> copy(nums);
        sort(copy.begin(), copy.end());
        int n = nums.size(), mid = (n + 1) >> 1;
        for(int i = mid - 1, j = 0; i >= 0; --i, j += 2) nums[j] = copy[i];
        for(int i = n - 1, j = 1; i >= mid; --i, j += 2) nums[j] = copy[i];
    }
};

2. Find the median instead of using sorting, then placement. ----O(n) time and O(n) space
Sorting can be overkill for the partition since we don't care about the order inside each half. We can simply find the median value and use
it to partition instead of sorting.
